{"name":"Nils’s dotfiles","body":"This repository contains my OS X shell configuration.\r\n\r\n1. Clone this repository.\r\n2. `cd` into it.\r\n3. Type `rake --tasks`.\r\n\r\nYou should see the following, where _~_ is the path to your home directory:\r\n\r\n    rake                        # Perform all setup tasks without overwriting existing files\r\n    rake set_up                 # Perform all setup tasks without overwriting existing files\r\n    rake set_up:all             # Perform all setup tasks without overwriting existing files\r\n    rake set_up:all:force       # Perform all setup tasks, replacing files as necessary\r\n    rake set_up:dotfiles        # Set up dotfiles in ~\r\n    rake set_up:dotfiles:force  # Delete and recreate dotfiles in ~\r\n    rake set_up:fonts           # Set up fonts\r\n    rake set_up:fonts:force     # Set up fonts, replacing files as necessary\r\n\r\nWhen you type `rake`, all the files in the root of this repository† are either\r\nsymbolically linked or generated into your home directory, with a dot prepended\r\nto the filename of each link. For example, the _gemrc_ in this repository gets\r\nsymbolically linked to _~/.gemrc_ (unless there is already a _.gemrc_ in your\r\nhome directory). The _vimrc.local.erb_ in this repository is used to generate\r\n_~/.vimrc.local_ (unless there is already a _.vimrc.local_ in your home\r\ndirectory).\r\n\r\nLeaving off the dots in these files makes them more convenient for me to edit\r\nand manage, and it allows me to ignore dotfiles that pertain to this repository\r\nrather than to my home directory.\r\n\r\nCredits\r\n-------\r\n\r\nThe\r\n[Mensch](http://robey.lag.net/2010/06/21/mensch-font.html \"Mensch, A Coding Font\")\r\nfont was created by [Robey Pointer](http://robey.lag.net).\r\n\r\nThe [Solarized](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized) color schemes were created\r\nby [Ethan Schoonover](http://ethanschoonover.com).\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n† Note: _Rakefile_ and _*.markdown_ are not treated as dotfiles.","tagline":"How I roll","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
